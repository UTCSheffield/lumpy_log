# Lumpy Log

Making Git Commits human readable by showing the important lumps of code.

## Aims

Make git repos easier for use in scenarios when communicating the progress of a project to none experts.

Converts each Commit to a MarkDown document detailing what was changed in each file but at the function / method level rather than line by line.

If there aren't functions / methods, Lumpy Log will try to find reasonable lumps of code to show.

This is one of a suite of tools being developed to help communicate the development of projects in the Computing Department @ UTC Sheffield OLP.

This also aims to demonstrate good practice and techniques within our own projects.
